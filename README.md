# 🚦 Road Accident Analytics SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data using **SQL Server** to identify accident patterns, high-risk factors, and trends related to casualties, vehicle types, and road conditions.

The objective is to support data-driven decision-making for traffic authorities, safety analysts, and policymakers by uncovering actionable insights from structured accident data.


## ❓ Problem Statement
Road accidents are a major cause of injuries and fatalities worldwide.  
Authorities need analytical insights to understand:
- Accident severity and casualty trends
- High-risk road and weather conditions
- Vehicle types involved in severe accidents
- Time-based accident patterns

This project addresses these challenges using SQL Server and relational data analysis.

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Total accidents and casualties analysis
- Accident severity distribution
- Vehicle type involvement in accidents
- Time-based accident trends (day, month)
- Road surface and weather condition impact
- High-risk accident scenarios
- Casualty severity analysis

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Certain road and weather conditions significantly increase accident severity.
- A small number of vehicle types contribute to a large portion of casualties.
- Accident frequency varies strongly by time and day.
- Severe accidents are more common under poor visibility and road conditions.
