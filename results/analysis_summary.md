# Road Accident Analytics – Analysis Summary

## 📌 Objective
Analyze road accident data to uncover patterns, high-risk factors, and trends in accident severity, casualties, and vehicles involved using SQL Server.

---

## 🚦 Accident Insights
- Severe accidents are concentrated on certain road types and under poor weather conditions.  
- Daytime accidents are more frequent, but night accidents have higher severity.  
- Accident frequency varies by date and time, highlighting high-risk periods.

## 🚗 Vehicle Insights
- Cars and trucks are most involved in severe accidents.  
- Vehicle type significantly impacts casualty severity.  
- Certain manoeuvres (e.g., overtaking, turning) are associated with higher-risk accidents.

## 👥 Casualty Insights
- A small percentage of accidents contribute to a large portion of casualties.  
- Multiple-casualty accidents often involve severe weather or poor visibility.  
- Analysis of casualty severity helps identify high-risk scenarios for drivers and passengers.
